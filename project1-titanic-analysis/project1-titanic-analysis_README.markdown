# Titanic Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover survival patterns using Python.

## Features
- Data cleaning (handling missing values).
- Visualizations (bar plots, histograms, heatmaps) using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Insights on survival rates by gender, class, and age.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `titanic_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Dataset: Titanic (via Seaborn)

## Insights
- Females had higher survival rates than males.
- First-class passengers had the highest survival rates.
- Younger passengers were more likely to survive.
